Pals is a mobile app built with React Native and Expo that helps you stay connected with your friends and family. It provides a simple and convenient way to keep track of your interactions with the people you care about.

Please note that Pals is currently available **only on Android**, but I might add iOS support in the near future.

## Features

- Import contacts from your phone into your "family" or "friends" list.
- Record your interactions with each contact, whether it's a phone call or an in-person meeting.
- Easily view and track the last interaction date for each contact in the main app view.
- View a detailed timeline of interactions with a particular contact, providing a comprehensive history of your connections.
- Two separate tabs: One for family and one for friends, allowing you to manage and view each list independently.
- Export and import your data to back up your interactions or transfer them to another device.
